## Skills, technologies, opinions

I ‚ù§ Nix.

### data engineering
* Spark, snowflake, dbt, ... are for "classic" analytics
* [Ray](https://www.ray.io/) is cool
* event-driven processing by default, recurrent batch processing when needed 
* data transformation should be a "build system", but we don't have the tools to do it (yet?)

### data science/ML
* tabular data: pandas, sklearn, catboost
* images: ConvNet, ResNet
* NLP: DistilBERT
* graphs: deep walk
* self-supervised learning looks promising

### software engineering
* functional programming (Haskell)
* apply FP ideas to any language (even to Python)
* OOP is _bad_
* OOP is _bad_, really
* DDD is good
* testing matters: unit tests, property testing, automated CI
* 100% automated deployement
* technological success includes reproducibility

### web applications
* frontend: React, css-in-js, functional reactive programming, JWT tokens in HTTP only cookies
* backend: feed data to SPA with GraphQL, make APIs with REST, Python Flask/Express JS are harder to scale, Haskell Scotty & morpheus is awesome, Java Spring Boot exists

### desktop application
* make a web app by default
* Java does the job
* electron is cool but heavy

### mobile development
* make a web app unless you have hard requirement on being offline

### business
* open source is a good strategy: monetize hardware and services, not software
