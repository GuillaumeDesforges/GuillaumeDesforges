## Skills, technologies, opinions

I can do anything most product software companies need.
<https://martinfowler.com/articles/expert-generalist.html>

In Data Engineering, I've done more specifically:
* analytics (Hadoop MapReduce, Spark, Modern Data Stack, superset)
* cloud data lakehouse (Spark SQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, Athena)
* parallel computing, distributed computing
* data transformation pipelines need similar features than build systems

<details>
<summary>My boring takes</summary>  

### software engineering
* static typing is a must
* apply FP ideas (Haskell, Scala) to other languages (Python, Rust, Java)
* Inheritance is _bad_
* Inheritance is _bad_, really
* Domain Driven Design (DDD) is good
* automated testing makes you faster
* aim for 100% automated infra ops
* NixOS is ❤

### web applications
* frontend: React is a good default, the Open Web Platform is most stable
* backend: most people call JSON-RPC APIs their "REST APIs", GraphQL is not a good place to start

### desktop application & mobile development
* make a web app
* if you need native functions, make a progressive web app
