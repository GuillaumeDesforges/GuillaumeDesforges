## Skills, technologies, opinions

<details>
<summary>My boring takes</summary>  

### data engineering
* analytics (Hadoop MapReduce, Spark, Modern Data Stack, superset)
* cloud data lakehouse (Spark SQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, Athena)
* parallel computing, distributed computing
* data transformation pipelines need similar features than build systems

### data science/ML
* you gotta love a good linear regression (or xgboost)
* aren't Foundational Models just crushing the field?

### software engineering
* static typing is a must
* type-hinted Python is nice
* apply FP ideas (Haskell, Scala) to other languages (Python, Rust, Java)
* Inheritance is _bad_
* Inheritance is _bad_, really
* Domain Driven Design (DDD) is good
* automated testing matters
* aim for 100% automated deployment
* NixOS is ❤

### web applications
* frontend: React is a good default, the Open Web Platform is most stable
* backend: REST is good, most people mean CRUD by REST, GraphQL is nice but complex, RPC is battle-tested
* HTMX is worth knowing

### desktop application & mobile development
* make a web app unless you need it offline
