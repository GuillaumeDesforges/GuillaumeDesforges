* analytics (Hadoop MapReduce, Spark, Modern Data Stack)
* cloud data lakehouse (Spark SQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, Athena)
* parallel computing, distributed computing ([Ray](https://www.ray.io/) is cool)
* data transformation pipelines need similar features than build systems

### data science/ML
* you've gotta love a good linear regression (or xgboost)
* aren't Foundational Models just crushing the field?

### software engineering
* functional programming (Haskell, Scala)
* apply FP ideas to other languages (Python, Rust, Java)
* Inheritance is _bad_
* Inheritance is _bad_, really
* Domain Driven Design (DDD) is good
* automated testing matters
* aim for 100% automated deployement
* technological success includes reproducibility (Nix ❤)

### web applications
* frontend: the Open Web Platform is the most stable, React is nice, experimenting with HTMX
* backend: REST is good, GraphQL is nice to serve SPA data but it's not so simple to solve N+1 query problem

### desktop application & mobile development
* make a web app unless you have hard requirement on being offline
